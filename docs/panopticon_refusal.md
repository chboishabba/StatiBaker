# Panopticon Refusal Manifesto (SB/ITIR)

## Preamble
Surveillance is not defined by cameras, logs, or storage. Surveillance is defined
by who is allowed to interpret memory, and with what authority. Memory becomes
coercive when capture is asymmetric, interpretation is centralized, forgetting
is invisible, and records are treated as truth rather than artifacts.

SB exists to do the opposite. This document states what SB **will not become**,
regardless of pressure, incentives, or convenience.

## 1. What SB Refuses
SB refuses the panopticon model: a system in which subjects are legible to power
while power remains illegible to subjects. SB is opinionated against coercive
memory.

## 2. Red-Flag Features SB Will Never Support

### 2.1 Authoritative interpretation
SB will never:
- auto-label behavior as good/bad/compliant/risky
- assign moral/legal/psychological meaning to events
- output findings, verdicts, or assessments

SB may emit signals, counts, intervals, and absence markers — never conclusions.

### 2.2 Global or cross-context identity resolution
SB will never:
- unify identities across contexts by default
- infer that two actors are the same person
- merge home/work/medical/legal timelines automatically

Identity linkage must be explicit, reversible, locally scoped, and human-acknowledged.

### 2.3 Hidden or passive capture
SB will never:
- silently record
- infer intent without declaration
- capture data without visible provenance

If capture occurred, SB must say how, when, and with what loss. If capture did
not occur, SB must say that too.

### 2.4 Predictive or preemptive judgment
SB will never:
- forecast behavior
- score risk
- simulate future compliance
- produce early-warning flags about people

Time in SB moves forward only. The future is not evidence.

### 2.5 Compression that conceals meaning
SB will never:
- summarize away uncertainty
- collapse disagreement into a single narrative
- compress without a declared loss profile

Every reduction must be explicit, inspectable, and expandable in principle.

### 2.6 Centralized memory authority
SB will never:
- designate a canonical history
- auto-reconcile competing accounts
- privilege institutional memory over personal memory

Plurality is the safeguard.

## 3. The Right to Opacity

### 3.1 Definition
Right to Opacity is the right for an actor or context to remain partially
unreadable, non-exhaustively represented, and uninterpreted by default.

Opacity is not secrecy. Opacity is refusal of forced legibility.

### 3.2 Opacity is not privacy
- Privacy protects who can see data; opacity protects whether data must mean anything.
- FOI assumes records are authoritative; SB refuses that assumption.

### 3.3 Opacity as a first-class SB primitive
SB enforces opacity through:
- absence-as-signal
- non-promotion of semantics
- refusal to normalize across domains
- loss-profile declarations
- separation of hypothesis from commitment

Opacity is preserved even when access is lawful and users are trusted.

## 4. Hypothesis vs Commitment (Epistemic Boundary)
SB distinguishes:
- Hypothesis: provisional, speculative, local, reversible, non-binding
- Commitment: declared, time-scoped, attributable, accountable, auditable

SB records commitments. SB does not upgrade hypotheses automatically.

## 5. UI Affordances That Resist Interpretation
- Absence is loud: gaps are visible and emphasized.
- Interpretation requires friction: explicit frames, windows, and assumptions.
- Competing views are shown side-by-side; no auto-merge.
- Status badges are epistemic, not moral.
- Expansion is always possible in principle (loss profiles shown).

## 6. SB vs FOI vs Surveillance
- FOI forces disclosure and assumes records are true.
- Surveillance captures by default and interprets centrally.
- SB captures explicitly, interprets locally, and refuses closure.

SB does not oppose transparency. SB opposes epistemic coercion.

## 7. Maximum Acceptable Blast Radius (Restated)
If SB fails:
- only the current run is affected
- only declared sources are implicated
- no hidden inference persists
- no future interpretation is polluted

Failure must be local, visible, bounded, and reversible.

## 8. Final Refusal
SB will never claim to:
- know who someone is
- know what something means
- know what will happen
- know what should be done

SB answers only: what was observed, under which conditions, and with what
uncertainty. Everything beyond that remains human and contestable.

## 9. State Power and Structural Violence (Operational-Political Note)
State violence is epistemic first and physical second. Harm begins when records
are treated as authoritative, absence is interpreted as guilt, ambiguity is
resolved unilaterally, and interpretation is enforced rather than debated. SB
exists to introduce epistemic friction against those pipelines.

SB therefore refuses:
- suspicion pipelines (predictive policing, risk scoring, pre-incident flags)
- category promotion that coerces identity across domains
- timelines that collapse ambiguity into intent
- claims that “the log speaks for itself”

SB treats sensor evidence (bodycams, drones, telemetry) as partial, situated,
and lossy. It records artifacts and absences, never conclusions. Lawful access
does not imply interpretive authority; compliance with access does not concede
narrative control.

This is not opposition to transparency. It is a refusal to let memory harden
into unchallengeable truth.
